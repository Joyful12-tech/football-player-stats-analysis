## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing football player statistics to uncover meaningful insights from raw, messy data. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and building an interactive Streamlit dashboard. By transforming unstructured player data into a professional analytics tool, the project demonstrates how data can be used for scouting, recruitment strategies, and performance evaluation.
The final dashboard allows users to filter by clubs, positions, and players while exploring top scorers, assist leaders, market values, and discipline trends. This end-to-end pipeline highlights my skills in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Streamlit, and data storytelling.

# ðŸ”Ž Project Workflow
|Stage	|Key Actions / Insights
|---|---|
|Data Cleaning	|Removed duplicates, Handled missing values, Standardized categorical variables (Club, Nationality, Position),Converted market values into numerical form|
|Summary Statistics  |Distribution of ages, goals, assists, and market values, Top clubs & player representation|
|Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	 |Top 10 goal scorers & assist leaders, Market value distribution by club, Correlation analysis (Goals vs Assists, Age vs Market Value), Discipline analysis (Yellow & Red cards)| 
|Visualizations	 |Bar plots, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, Focused on player performance & discipline trends|
|Interactive Dashboard	 |Filters by club, player, and position, KPIs (total goals, assists, avg. market value), Visual exploration of top scorers, assists, and discipline metrics|

# ðŸ“Š Results & Insights
